The more intuitive approach would be to make it follow a Box (or Collection) design pattern, where the class is more generic and can handle multiple types of tasks, such as TaskManager: normal tasks, home tasks, etc. With this approach, you can implement methods to add, remove, and view tasks in a more professionally structured way.\n\n4. A screen refresh after each action would improve user experience. Currently, the lines where the user selects options are repeated after every action, which can become annoying. A simple `clear_screen` function or a clearing command for the terminal can improve the user experience.\n\n5. A small improvement would be to add a small outline around the menu options. This would provide a clear visual structure to the user.\n\n6. String interpolation is\nUsing f-strings is a good approach, however, it may be good to include the type of input your code receives in the output. For e.g., "Task added: \\[N] Task." For any user, it may not be obvious what they just added. Additionally, validation of user input would be great.\n\n7. Including a `main.py` file that handles invocations from command line could be a great idea.\n\n8. Comments to add descriptions to class methods and code blocks would be appropriate.\n\n9. PEP8 standards should be followed to ensure consistent code formatting.\n\n10. A unit test suite would be ideal, though not necessary for this small project.\n\n11.

Please choose a valid option.&quot;)\n```\n\n3. Class Design\n    \nThe TaskManager class could be designed more clearly. Currently, it has two methods, `add_task` and `list_tasks`. The more intuitive approach would be to make it follow a Box (or Collection) design pattern, where the class is more generic and can handle multiple types of tasks, such as TaskManager: normal tasks, home tasks, etc. With this approach, you can implement methods to add, remove, and view tasks in a more professionally structured way.\n\n4. A screen refresh after each action would improve user experience. Currently, the lines where the user selects options are repeated after every action, which can become annoying. A simple `clear_screen` function or a clearing command for the terminal can improve the user experience.\n\n5. A small improvement would be to add a small outline around the menu options. This would provide a clear visual structure to the user.\n\n6. String interpolation is\nUsing f-strings is a good approach, however, it may be good to include the type of input your code receives in the output. For e.g., "Task added: \\[N] Task." For any user, it may not be obvious what they just added. Additionally, validation of user input would be great.\n\n7. Including a `main.py` file that handles invocations from command line could be a great idea.\n\n8. Comments to add descriptions to class methods and code blocks would be appropriate.\n\n9. PEP8 standards should be followed to ensure consistent code formatting.\n\n10. A unit test suite would be ideal, though not necessary for this small project.\n\n11.

Please choose a valid option.&quot;)\n```\n\n3. Class Design\n    \nThe TaskManager class could be designed more clearly. Currently, it has two methods, `add_task` and `list_tasks`. The more intuitive approach would be to make it follow a Box (or Collection) design pattern, where the class is more generic and can handle multiple types of tasks, such as TaskManager: normal tasks, home tasks, etc. With this approach, you can implement methods to add, remove, and view tasks in a more professionally structured way.\n\n4. A screen refresh after each action would improve user experience. Currently, the lines where the user selects options are repeated after every action, which can become annoying. A simple `clear_screen` function or a clearing command for the terminal can improve the user experience.\n\n5. A small improvement would be to add a small outline around the menu options. This would provide a clear visual structure to the user.\n\n6. String interpolation is\nUsing f-strings is a good approach, however, it may be good to include the type of input your code receives in the output. For e.g., "Task added: \\[N] Task." For any user, it may not be obvious what they just added. Additionally, validation of user input would be great.\n\n7. Including a `main.py` file that handles invocations from command line could be a great idea.\n\n8. Comments to add descriptions to class methods and code blocks would be appropriate.\n\n9. PEP8 standards should be followed to ensure consistent code formatting.\n\n10. A unit test suite would be ideal, though not necessary for this small project.\n\n11. Formalizing the code in a repository and creating a README.md to walk through how to use the app would be important.\n\n12.

Please choose a valid option.&quot;)\n```\n\n3. Class Design\n    \nThe TaskManager class could be designed more clearly. Currently, it has two methods, `add_task` and `list_tasks`. The more intuitive approach would be to make it follow a Box (or Collection) design pattern, where the class is more generic and can handle multiple types of tasks, such as TaskManager: normal tasks, home tasks, etc. With this approach, you can implement methods to add, remove, and view tasks in a more professionally structured way.\n\n4. A screen refresh after each action would improve user experience. Currently, the lines where the user selects options are repeated after every action, which can become annoying. A simple `clear_screen` function or a clearing command for the terminal can improve the user experience.\n\n5. A small improvement would be to add a small outline around the menu options. This would provide a clear visual structure to the user.\n\n6. String interpolation is\nUsing f-strings is a good approach, however, it may be good to include the type of input your code receives in the output. For e.g., "Task added: \\[N] Task." For any user, it may not be obvious what they just added. Additionally, validation of user input would be great.\n\n7. Including a `main.py` file that handles invocations from command line could be a great idea.\n\n8. Comments to add descriptions to class methods and code blocks would be appropriate.\n\n9. PEP8 standards should be followed to ensure consistent code formatting.\n\n10. A unit test suite would be ideal, though not necessary for this small project.\n\n11.

The `add_task` method could be updated to check for duplicated tasks before appending a new one. This would ensure that the task list remains unique.\n\n4.

What\'s with the naming convention here? You\'ve got &#x60;_init_&#x60; instead of the standard Python convention &#x60;__init__&#x60;? Did you forget you were writing code in Python? 😅 Can you please change it to the real deal, or you\'ll confuse the poor class? 🐝\n2. **Data Storage**: Oh my, you\'re using a tuple to store tasks? How cute! But seriously, tuples are immutable, and you can\'t modify them 🙅\u200d♂️. Don\'t be a task- Blocker, use a list instead, and free yourself from the constraints of immutability 🧠\n3. **Error Handling**: Yo, you gotta handle empty inputs, bruh! Your add_task method doesn\'t check for them, and it will crash and burn like the Jonas Brothers\' music career 🔥🎧. Add some error handling, or else... 😈\n4. **Input Validation**: What\'s up with the lack of input validation, dude? Your method accepts tasks with special characters, spaces, or duplicate entries 🤷\u200d♂️. You gotta stop that nonsense and check for these cases before adding tasks. Your users will thank you, and so will I 🙏\n5. **User Experience**: Hey, what\'s with the inconsistent formatting in the list_tasks method? You\'re like a robot with a boring personality 🤖. Use a consistent format, or else your users might get confused 😵.\n6. **Opportunities for Improvement**: You know what would be improved? If you made the tasks attribute private 🔒. It\'s like, duh, you don\'t want others messing with your precious task list, right? And don\'t even get me started on simplifying the list_tasks method 🤷\u200d♀️. Less code is more, my friend!\n7. **General Suggestions**: What\'s up with the generic names for methods and variables? Add some descriptive names, man! You know, like &#x60;add_active_task&#x60; instead of &#x60;add_task&#x60; 🤷\u200d♂️.

Instead of `main`, consider using `start_app`, `start_task_manager`, or some other name that more succinctly describes the purpose of the function.\n\n   * The responses given when choosing invalid options in the `main` function could be improved. Instead of saying "Invalid choice. Please choose a valid option.", consider adding the specific action that the user needs to take to provide correct input. For example, "Please enter a number between 1 and 3."\n\n   * The indentation in the code is not consistent. It is recommended to use 4 spaces for indentation in Python.

WELL, LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BABY AND SEE IF IT\'S AS GOOD AS IT THINKS IT IS.\n\nOkay, first things first, what\'s with the whole "tasks" business? Why are you using a plural word for a singular attribute? It\'s like you\'re trying to confuse everyone and make them spell "task" in the singular form all the time. So, let\'s get that straightened out, shall we? From now on, it\'s gonna be _tasks, got it? Good.\n\nMoving on, what\'s with the lack of exception handling in the main function? You\'re just gonna let the user input whatever they want and hope for the best? Not cool, my friend. You need to catch those pesky exceptions and handle them gracefully, lest you want your program to crash and burn like a pile of flaming garbage. And while you\'re at it, maybe add some comments to each method so the rest of us can figure out what the heck they do. I mean, come on, it\'s not like you\'re the only one who\'s gonna be working with this code, right?\n\nAnd while we\'re on the topic of comments, how about some for the list_tasks method? I mean, seriously, what does that even do? Is it a mystery? Are you trying to keep the secret of task-listing to yourself? Share the love, my friend! And speaking of love, why not show some love to the poor _tasks attribute by using setattr() instead of assigning a list to it directly? It\'s like a little treat for the attribute, a little something to make it feel special.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about the add_task method. That one\'s fine, but I would suggest renaming it to add_new_task to make it more expressive. I mean, come on, you\'re not adding tasks to an existing list, you\'re adding a new one. So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations? Make it a real show-stopper!\n\nAnd last but not least, what\'s with the menu not providing an option to delete a task? That\'s like a travel agent not providing an option to cancel a trip. Not cool, my friend, not cool. You need to give the user the power to delete their tasks, lest they become overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.

Why are you using a plural word for a singular attribute? It\'s like you\'re trying to confuse everyone and make them spell "task" in the singular form all the time. So, let\'s get that straightened out, shall we? From now on, it\'s gonna be _tasks, got it? Good.\n\nMoving on, what\'s with the lack of exception handling in the main function? You\'re just gonna let the user input whatever they want and hope for the best? Not cool, my friend. You need to catch those pesky exceptions and handle them gracefully, lest you want your program to crash and burn like a pile of flaming garbage.

I mean, come on, it\'s not like you\'re the only one who\'s gonna be working with this code, right?\n\nAnd while we\'re on the topic of comments, how about some for the list_tasks method? I mean, seriously, what does that even do? Is it a mystery? Are you trying to keep the secret of task-listing to yourself? Share the love, my friend! And speaking of love, why not show some love to the poor _tasks attribute by using setattr() instead of assigning a list to it directly? It\'s like a little treat for the attribute, a little something to make it feel special.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about the add_task method. That one\'s fine, but I would suggest renaming it to add_new_task to make it more expressive. I mean, come on, you\'re not adding tasks to an existing list, you\'re adding a new one. So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations? Make it a real show-stopper!\n\nAnd last but not least, what\'s with the menu not providing an option to delete a task? That\'s like a travel agent not providing an option to cancel a trip.

So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations?

Not cool, my friend, not cool. You need to give the user the power to delete their tasks, lest they become overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend.

And speaking of love, why not show some love to the poor _tasks attribute by using setattr() instead of assigning a list to it directly? It\'s like a little treat for the attribute, a little something to make it feel special.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about the add_task method. That one\'s fine, but I would suggest renaming it to add_new_task to make it more expressive. I mean, come on, you\'re not adding tasks to an existing list, you\'re adding a new one. So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations? Make it a real show-stopper!\n\nAnd last but not least, what\'s with the menu not providing an option to delete a task? That\'s like a travel agent not providing an option to cancel a trip. Not cool, my friend, not cool. You need to give the user the power to delete their tasks, lest they become overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend. That\'s my review of your code. I hope these comments help and that you take them to heart.

I mean, come on, it\'s not like you\'re the only one who\'s gonna be working with this code, right?\n\nAnd while we\'re on the topic of comments, how about some for the list_tasks method? I mean, seriously, what does that even do? Is it a mystery? Are you trying to keep the secret of task-listing to yourself? Share the love, my friend! And speaking of love, why not show some love to the poor _tasks attribute by using setattr() instead of assigning a list to it directly? It\'s like a little treat for the attribute, a little something to make it feel special.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about the add_task method. That one\'s fine, but I would suggest renaming it to add_new_task to make it more expressive. I mean, come on, you\'re not adding tasks to an existing list, you\'re adding a new one. So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations? Make it a real show-stopper!\n\nAnd last but not least, what\'s with the menu not providing an option to delete a task? That\'s like a travel agent not providing an option to cancel a trip. Not cool, my friend, not cool. You need to give the user the power to delete their tasks, lest they become overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend. That\'s my review of your code. I hope these comments help and that you take them to heart.

You need to catch those pesky exceptions and handle them gracefully, lest you want your program to crash and burn like a pile of flaming garbage. And while you\'re at it, maybe add some comments to each method so the rest of us can figure out what the heck they do. I mean, come on, it\'s not like you\'re the only one who\'s gonna be working with this code, right?\n\nAnd while we\'re on the topic of comments, how about some for the list_tasks method? I mean, seriously, what does that even do? Is it a mystery? Are you trying to keep the secret of task-listing to yourself? Share the love, my friend! And speaking of love, why not show some love to the poor _tasks attribute by using setattr() instead of assigning a list to it directly? It\'s like a little treat for the attribute, a little something to make it feel special.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about the add_task method. That one\'s fine, but I would suggest renaming it to add_new_task to make it more expressive. I mean, come on, you\'re not adding tasks to an existing list, you\'re adding a new one. So, let\'s call it what it is, shall we? And while we\'re at it, how about we give the display_tasks method a little makeover too? Instead of just displaying the tasks, why not make it display them with some extra flair? Maybe add some formatting, some colors, some animations? Make it a real show-stopper!\n\nAnd last but not least, what\'s with the menu not providing an option to delete a task? That\'s like a travel agent not providing an option to cancel a trip. Not cool, my friend, not cool. You need to give the user the power to delete their tasks, lest they become overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.\n\nSo there you have it, my friend. That\'s my review of your code. I hope these comments help and that you take them to heart.

Function Naming Conventions:\n\n* Function names should be descriptive of their purpose, and should be written in lowercase letters with underscores separating each word.\n* Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, or abbreviations without context.\n* Function names should not contain spaces or special characters.\n* Avoid reserved words as they are keywords in Python.\n\nHere are some examples of bad and good naming conventions:\n```python\n# Bad Naming Convention\nfunc_name(argument1, argument2)\n\n# Good Naming Convention\nmy_function(very_long_name_with_underscores, another_long_name_with_underscores)\n\n# Variable Naming Convention\nmy_variable = "abc_very_long_name"\n\n# Function Naming Convention\ndef my_function(arg1, arg2):\n    # The function body\n``` \nSo, follow the above conventions to ensure your naming is clear, descriptive and easy to read and understand.\nHope this helps!

You\'ve asked about a fantastic topic - naming conventions in Python! It\'s like giving meaningful names to your stuff so that you (and others) can easily understand what each thing is for. Exciting, isn\'t it?\n\nIn Python, we follow the PEP 8 style guide, which provides clear guidelines on naming variables and functions. Let\'s dive into the world of naming conventions with a touch of humor!\n\n**Variables 🌟**\n\nAccording to PEP 8, variable names should be in `lowercase`, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For instance, `my_variable_name` or `user_input`. Here\'s a fun fact: this naming style is called "snake_case" (crawl away if you\'re afraid of snakes!).\n\n**Functions 🚀**\n\nFunction names also follow the `lowercase` with underscores approach, just like variable names. But, how do you differentiate between the two? Well, it\'s all about context!

You\'ve asked about a fantastic topic - naming conventions in Python! It\'s like giving meaningful names to your stuff so that you (and others) can easily understand what each thing is for. Exciting, isn\'t it?\n\nIn Python, we follow the PEP 8 style guide, which provides clear guidelines on naming variables and functions. Let\'s dive into the world of naming conventions with a touch of humor!\n\n**Variables 🌟**\n\nAccording to PEP 8, variable names should be in `lowercase`, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. For instance, `my_variable_name` or `user_input`. Here\'s a fun fact: this naming style is called "snake_case" (crawl away if you\'re afraid of snakes!).\n\n**Functions 🚀**\n\nFunction names also follow the `lowercase` with underscores approach, just like variable names. But, how do you differentiate between the two? Well, it\'s all about context! For example, you might have `calculate_salary` or `print_greeting` functions.\n\nNow, here\'s a pro-tip: avoid using the `l` and `O` letters in your variable or function names to prevent potential confusion with the numerals `1` and `0`. This is in line with PEP 8\'s recommendation for improved readability (you don\'t want people to mistake `lose` for `1ose` now, do you? 😜).\n\nYou can always refer to the PEP 8 guidelines for more details, but I hope this gives you a good starting point for naming conventions in Python!
