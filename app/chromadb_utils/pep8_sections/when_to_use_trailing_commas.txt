Trailing commas are usually optional, except they are mandatory when
making a tuple of one element.  For clarity, it is recommended to
surround the latter in (technically redundant) parentheses:

.. code-block::
   :class: good

   # Correct:
   FILES = ('setup.cfg',)

.. code-block::
   :class: bad

   # Wrong:
   FILES = 'setup.cfg',

When trailing commas are redundant, they are often helpful when a
version control system is used, when a list of values, arguments or
imported items is expected to be extended over time.  The pattern is
to put each value (etc.) on a line by itself, always adding a trailing
comma, and add the close parenthesis/bracket/brace on the next line.
However it does not make sense to have a trailing comma on the same
line as the closing delimiter (except in the above case of singleton
tuples):

.. code-block::
   :class: good

   # Correct:
   FILES = [
       'setup.cfg',
       'tox.ini',
       ]
   initialize(FILES,
              error=True,
              )

.. code-block::
   :class: bad

   # Wrong:
   FILES = ['setup.cfg', 'tox.ini',]
   initialize(FILES, error=True,)
