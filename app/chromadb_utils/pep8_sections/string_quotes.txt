In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the
same.  This PEP does not make a recommendation for this.  Pick a rule
and stick to it.  When a string contains single or double quote
characters, however, use the other one to avoid backslashes in the
string. It improves readability.

For triple-quoted strings, always use double quote characters to be
consistent with the docstring convention in :pep:`257`.
