        **Empowering Coders with Humor and Expertise**

        We are a dynamic team of both developers and educators driven 
        by a shared passion for transforming the way people learn programming. 
        We've developed "AI, Roast My Code" with the goal to 
        making Python programming engaging and straightforward, ensuring 
        learning is both enjoyable and accessible. 

        Our collaboration began with a simple idea: learning to code should be 
        enjoyable and fun! Each of us brings a wealth of experience in software 
        development, AI technologies, and educational methodologies, united by 
        our commitment to innovate and inspire.

        Leveraging Lastmile AIâ€™s cutting-edge AIConfig framework, we have crafted 
        an application that not only assesses Python coding skills but does so 
        with a playful twist. Our approach uses humor-infused feedback to provide 
        learners with a memorable and effective educational experience, encouraging 
        continuous learning and improvement.

        We believe that the best way to learn is by keeping the process 
        light-hearted and engaging. That's why "AI, Roast My Code" integrates 
        intelligent AI-driven analyses with witty commentary that guides learning 
        but also adds entertainment. Our goal is to build a community of learners who feel 
        empowered and motivated to explore the vast possibilities of coding.

        Join us on this journey to redefine coding educationâ€”one roast at a time.
